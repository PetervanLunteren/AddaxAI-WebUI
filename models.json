This classifier was trained at Google using a large dataset of camera trap images and an EfficientNet V2 M architecture (https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00574). It is designed to classify images into one of more than 2000 labels, covering diverse animal species, higher-level taxa (like 'mammalia' or 'felidae'), and non-animal classes ('blank', 'vehicle'). The SpeciesNet classifier is typically run in an ensemble with MegaDetector (https://github.com/agentmorris/MegaDetector), an object detector that identifies the locations and types of objects present in camera trap images, categorizing them as animals, humans, or vehicles. The SpeciesNet ensemble combines these two models using a set of heuristics and, optionally, geofencing rules and taxonomic aggregation that take into account the geographical origin of the image to improve the reliability of its species classification. This ensemble is used for image classification in the Wildlife Insights platform (https://www.wildlifeinsights.org/).",

        "description": "This model distinguishes between 27 species native to the Southwest United States. The training data was collected partially by SDZWA and the California Mountain Lion Project, and includes examples from the NACTI, and CCT training datasets. The training data corpus comprises 91662 images. We used a 70/20/10 Train/Val/Test split. The model reached an overall accuracy of 88% on the test set. Created by Kyra Swanson in 2023 (tswanson@sdzwa.org).",

        "description": "This model classifies 13 species or higher taxonomic groups found in the Kuraiyama Experimental Forest (KEF) of Gifu University. It was trained on approximately 23,000 camera trap images collected through a wildlife monitoring project in KEF. The model was developed to support the efficient monitoring of key wildlife species in central Japan, sika deer, wild boar, Asian black bear, and Japanese serow. The class-wise accuracies for these four representative species are as follows: deer 0.97, boar 0.94, black bear 0.82, and serow 0.88. Please note that the model was trained on data limited to KEF and its surrounding area, and it has not yet undergone a comprehensive accuracy evaluation. The training data is also limited and imbalanced. This model is intended as a prototype for future development of models for classifying wild animals in Japan.The image dataset used to train this model is the same as the one used in Ando et al. (2019). However, data of humans and dogs were not used for training. Ando et al. (2019) Recognition of wildlife using deep learning in images taken by camera traps.
